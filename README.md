# The Gurus - Fog project

## About us
We are group of three developers, who are currently finishing our first year of our AP in Computer Science. 
The project was build during a 5week period. 
During the weeks we used scrum as our work tool, in which we had weekly review with the "customer" which was really our teacher.


## Project purpose
This project was build with Java, our backend is connected to a MySQL database.
This program is using apache tomcat, to fire up our jsp sites.

The purpose of this system, is to replicate/improve some parts of a danish company called Johannes Fog.

The system is meant to give a smoother experience for customers, as well as salesmen when orders are created.
